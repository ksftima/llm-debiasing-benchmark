# Section 1: The header
# when building, apptainer downloads this image and uses it as a starting point

# go fetch base image from docker hub
Bootstrap: docker

# the image name - ubuntu base gives us both R and Python cleanly
From: ubuntu:22.04

# Section 2: Files
# This sections copies files from my machine into the container at build time
%files
    requirements_container.txt /opt/requirements_container.txt
# left side: req...txt — the file on my machine (relative to where the .def file lives)
# right side: /tmp/req...txt — where it lands inside the container
# NOTE: %files runs before %post. apptainer copies files in first and then installs commands

# Section 3: %post
# %post is where we install things, bunch of shell commands running once, 
# at build time inside the container

# Section 3.1: Environment
# This section sets the environment vars that are active every time the container runs!!
%environment
    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
    export LC_ALL=C
    export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

    # 1. apt-get update: refreshes the list of available packages
    # 2. apt-get install -y: -y means yes to all prompts
    # 3. --no-install-recommends: only installs what's asked
    # 4. gcc/g++: c compilers needed for python packages
    # 5. r-base/r-base-dev: R runtime
    # 6. r-cran-lme4/r-cran-tidyverse: pre-compiled R packages via apt (avoids compilation issues)
    # 7. libcurl4-openssl-dev/libssl-dev: needed for remaining R packages
    # 8. DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive: suppresses interactive prompts during build

    # Section 2.1 Pip Installs
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    pip3 install -r /opt/requirements_container.txt

    # 1. --upgrade pip: updates pip itself first, good practice
    # 2. torch --index-url ..: installs torch separately since transformers depend on it 
    # + also only installs the cpu version that is lighter than GPU 2GB vs 200MB
    # 3. -r/tmp/requ...txt: installs everythin in the req file. 
    # /tmp/ path is where we put that file in the container
    # NOTE: the order matters!! torch first then everything else

# 1. LC_ALL=C: sets local to safe default to avoid locale files errors
# 2. PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1: set to =1 means that log output prints immediately 
# instead of chunks!! imp when watching logs

%help 
    Development usage (bind-mound code and data at runtime):
        apptainer exec \
            --bind /path/to/thesis:/code \
            --bind /path/to/datasets:/data\
            thesis.sif python /code/script.py

    Interactive shell inside the container:
        apptainer shell --bind /path/to/thesis:/code thesis.sif

# this .def file will create a .sif file. a sif file is the output
# of the build, the frozen finished container- its immutable!
# its portable, we can scp it to Vera
# do not commit the sif, only commit the .def!
