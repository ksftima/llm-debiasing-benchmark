{"text":{"0":"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as a large increase in exports of goods and services more than offset a moderate increase in imports.","1":"Based on historical experience, it seems improbable that all of the large rise in multifactor productivity could be attributed to cyclical or transitory factors.","2":"This was also an era when the principal mortgage lenders, savings and loans, were sometimes constrained from satisfying mortgage demands by binding Regulation Q ceilings that eroded their deposit base when interest rates rose.","3":"The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.","4":"However, we have also found that excluding volatile food and energy prices generally gives a better sense of underlying inflation pressures that are likely to persist and dominate total inflation over time.","5":"In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy.","6":"In addition, U.S. inflation remains muted.","7":"These geopolitical events also pose downside risks to growth.","8":"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters,","9":"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","10":"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Tim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","11":"In the productivity boom that followed World War I, a chief technological innovation was the spread of electrification to the factory floor.","12":"Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates.","13":"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.","14":"While the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy.","15":"But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.","16":"The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1\/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","17":"Spreads on risky private-sector debt reached very low levels, and damaging spillovers to the nonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive leverage by borrowers in the housing market.","18":"As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve some moderation in the growth of economic activity to a rate more consistent with the expansion of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlying productive capacity.","19":"Significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year","20":"They noted that the economy had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an unsustainable rate.","21":"Some participants judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, particularly in the near term, in light of the large amount of resource slack already prevailing in the economy, the significant downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to low actual inflation.","22":"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.","23":"Of the 1,700 Washington employees, roughly 250 are Ph.D. economists, the majority of whom support the Board's monetary policy responsibilities.","24":"Regarding the ELB, the previous statement was silent on the global decline in neutral policy rates, the likelihood that the ELB will constrain monetary policy space in economic downturns, and the implications of this constraint for our ability to achieve our dual-mandate goals.","25":"To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest.","26":"The \u201cextended period\u201d language is conditioned on exactly those same points: \u201cExtended period\u201d is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.","27":"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","28":"A few participants judged that the expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in financial markets were currently suggesting greater provision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary for the Committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policymakers' own expectations for that path.","29":"another indicated that the Committee could provide guidance stating that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level at a specific horizon.","30":"The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U. S. Treasury yield curve, increased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depreciation.","31":"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","32":"We found that a surprise increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about 1 percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect on stock prices.17 Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission.","33":"Operationally, maintaining price stability requires abiding by the Taylor principle of raising nominal interest rates more than one for one in response to movements in inflation, especially those movements perceived as persistent.","34":"The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes.","35":"And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices?","36":"As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply.","37":"Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate-consistent levels.","38":"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.","39":"Returning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on today\u2019s policy decision.","40":"It is an honor to be here with Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who pioneered the original Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy in 2012.","41":"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.","42":"Participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates.","43":"To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19 We also need to pick values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 There are still other choices to make.","44":"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.","45":"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","46":"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","47":"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.","48":"So the term \u201ctrend inflation\u201d\u2014usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.","49":"In the Committee\u2019s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1\/4 percent at this meeting.","50":"But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply.","51":"Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid.","52":"While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices.","53":"Money growth was damped by a rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets (as typically occurs in periods of policy tightening).","54":"A few participants pointed to continued strong growth in multifamily construction, although the limited pipeline of new projects in one District suggested that activity could slow in 2015.","55":"The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up a little, as recent data showed somewhat faster-than-anticipated increases that were judged to be only partly transitory.","56":"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.","57":"Some saw a risk that inflationary pressures might develop more rapidly than currently anticipated as resource utilization tightened,","58":"I believe the current move can be justified in a forward-looking variant of the Taylor Rule, where today's policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation.","59":"The shift in the stance of monetary policy that we undertook in 2019 was, I believe, well timed and has been providing support to the economy and helping to keep the U.S. outlook on track.","60":"Some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher, it appeared that the pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited.","61":"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","62":"Consumer food prices were little changed in August.","63":"largely as a consequence of further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity.","64":"In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.","65":"In contrast, in cases in which variations in the demand for reserves or in external factors affecting reserve supply appear likely to be temporary, the Desk typically prefers to conduct open-market operations through short-term or long-term repurchase agreements, known as repos.","66":"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.","67":"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","68":"Conversely, fiscal policy expansion in the surplus countries could be used to augment domestic demand, but any such adjustments would need to take account of medium-term goals for fiscal consolidation.","69":"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","70":"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.","71":"Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.","72":"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity has slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter.","73":"The role of the Board vis-\u00e0-vis the regional Banks was elevated in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and in the early years of the Great Depression, but the combination of centralized and regional responsibilities remains an important strength of the Federal Reserve System, as I'll explain shortly when I discuss the formulation of monetary policy.","74":"Although the unemployment rate is around a 50-year low, wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.","75":"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.","76":"Members agreed that the statement should continue to convey that inflation risks remained of greatest concern and that additional policy firming was possible.","77":"Several participants commented that the factors that had contributed to low inflation during the previous expansion could again exert more downward pressure on inflation than expected.","78":"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter.","79":"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","80":"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","81":"Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U. S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy.","82":"One prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior","83":"Accordingly, considerable caution needed to be exercised in assessing the outlook for productivity and in relying on projections of the economy and prices, which necessarily embodied judgments about this outlook, in making monetary policy.","84":"several others thought that progress in achieving the Committee's inflation objective might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization.","85":"Fourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial Crisis\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.","86":"Millions of new jobs have been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at or below 5 percent for over two years.","87":"At the same time, the incentive to take advantage of increasingly efficient high-tech equipment and software typically available at declining prices would continue to provide an important underpinning for further large gains in investment spending, with favorable implications for continued rapid growth in productivity.","88":"Members referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms.","89":"Clearly, businesses regarded such investments as highly profitable, and they appeared to be leading to gains in productivity that in turn were helping to offset rising compensation and to maintain profit margins in highly competitive markets.","90":"increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.","91":"For example, the evidence suggests that changes in the demographic composition of the labor force affect NAIRU and it is also likely that government programs, including unemployment compensation and welfare, also affect NAIRU.","92":"The Committee also reiterated that it would continue its asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.","93":"And no, we\u2019re not\u2014we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven\u2019t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","94":"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","95":"As a result, the likely pace and extent of policy easing expected by investors increased, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities fell.","96":"For instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business spending, output, and prices.7 In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or, instead, to \"look through\" such shocks, policymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the effects and how widespread they are.","97":"Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.","98":"In the United States, evaluating the effects on the economy of shifts in balance sheets and variations in asset prices have been an integral part of the development of monetary policy.","99":"As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points.","100":"Nonetheless, given a recovery in U. S. domestic demand approximating their current forecasts, growth in imports likely would exceed that of exports by a wide margin over the forecast horizon.","101":"However, indicators of economic activity in Japan and Brazil remained weak.","102":"In addition, to address the sizable demand for dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions, the FOMC authorized the expansion of its existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank; by the end of the intermeeting period, the formal quantity limits on these lines had been eliminated.","103":"While moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal funds rate may well affect capital flows, interest rates and asset prices in EMEs, the overall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive.","104":"Mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight over the intermeeting period, though signs of easing continued to emerge amid further gains in house prices.","105":"Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market.","106":"The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force.","107":"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.","108":"Returns on indexed bonds are tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money.","109":"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the \"extended period\" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response.","110":"Long-term sovereign bond yields declined notably in the advanced economies, in part as foreign central banks announced additional monetary policy easing measures.","111":"The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.","112":"However, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields.","113":"These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.","114":"U.S. inflation remains muted.","115":"Participants expected that productivity growth would pick up as firms slowed hiring to a pace more in line with output growth but acknowledged that the improvement might be limited, particularly if business investment spending were to remain soft.","116":"Well, that\u2019s\u2014what\u2019s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.","117":"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.","118":"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months,","119":"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","120":"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports.","121":"If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.","122":"But in many countries around the Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we\u2019ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade with us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well.","123":"Martin Baily and Robert Lawrence (2004) present a much more thorough analysis of this issue and come to a similar conclusion.4 To investigate further the relationship between restructuring and labor productivity, we compared the performance of industry employment to the performance of industry productivity for the period from 2000 to 2002 (chart 5).","124":"So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at\u2014able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.","125":"Inflation expectations that currently appeared by various measures and survey results to be essentially flat or even to have declined a bit were reinforcing the factors holding down price increases.","126":"Recent data on core consumer prices led the staff to mark down slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation.","127":"Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.","128":"Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.","129":"In particular, a surprise tightening of policy raises the risk premium, lowering current stock prices, and a surprise easing lowers the risk premium, raising current stock prices.","130":"Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.","131":"Although the pace of job losses was moderating, the unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek pointed to only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeded.","132":"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, the staff's outlook for real economic activity was broadly similar to that at the time of the January meeting.","133":"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","134":"The literature on this topic extends at least as far back as William Brainard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 Brainard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy.","135":"At the moment, trend growth near full employment appears to be a reasonable prospect in the year ahead.","136":"The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.","137":"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who\u2019ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.","138":"A number of participants indicated that the Committee should resume asset purchases only if substantially adverse economic circumstances warranted greater monetary policy accommodation than could be provided by lowering the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound.","139":"In its March forecast, the staff's projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was somewhat higher than the one presented in January, mostly reflecting an improved outlook for economic activity abroad, a lower foreign exchange value for the dollar, and a higher projected path of equity prices.","140":"King (1999) shows that, if a long enough interval is given to hit the target, there may be little difference between a price level target and an inflation rate target.","141":"They noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.","142":"Holiday shopping reportedly was relatively solid, and, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, demand for home furnishings and construction materials was up.","143":"Monetary policy has an ambiguous effect on trade imbalances.","144":"Thus, knowing where productivity growth is headed is, in many respects, equivalent to foreseeing our economic destinies.","145":"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average.","146":"Together these structural changes would imply that the economy can now operate at a lower unemployment rate and at a higher growth rate than previously without inflationary consequences.","147":"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.","148":"One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment","149":"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: \"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","150":"While participants generally felt that the pace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to developments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins.","151":"However, nothing prevents a central bank from switching its focus from the price of reserves to the quantity or growth of reserves.","152":"More fundamentally, however, the members believed that current growth in aggregate demand, should it persist, would continue to exceed the expansion of potential output and, by putting added pressure on already tight labor markets, would at some point foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economic expansion.","153":"Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.","154":"So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.","155":"Although some of the recent data on economic activity had been better than anticipated, most participants saw the incoming information as broadly in line with their earlier projections for moderate growth; accordingly, their views on the economic outlook had not changed appreciably.","156":"Of course, the basic problem in tackling the inflation of the 1970s is that we have one observation and many competing theories.","157":"Participants noted that the improved performance of investment suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.","158":"To cite a recent study, Faust and Wright (2007) show that real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons and that this advantage is not solely the result of the staff's expertise at estimating near-term inflation rates.","159":"the approach can be applied equally well by \"inflation hawks,\" \"growth hawks,\" and anyone in between.","160":"If independence is also defined in terms of assuring the ability and commitment of the central bank to achieve price stability, this commitment can be protected by an explicit price stability mandate from the government.","161":"however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter.","162":"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.","163":"That projection, along with the path to year-three inflation, should help the public differentiate short-term shocks to price stability from the longer-term price trends it should use for planning purposes.","164":"Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.","165":"Now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.","166":"A Framework for Analyzing the Growth of Labor ProductivityA great success story for the American economy has been the resurgence of productivity growth that began around 1995.1 From 1973 to 1995, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1-1\/2 percent.","167":"Indeed, the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model, if not subjected to judgmental adjustments, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992.","168":"However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weaker-than-expected U. S. employment report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher against EME currencies.","169":"The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows over most of the intermeeting period.","170":"Nonetheless, all but one of the members believed that in light of the uncertainties about the economic outlook, an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence of firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging.","171":"Therefore, monetary policy in Japan might be affected not only by views about how such policies would affect macroeconomic performance, for given fiscal policies,","172":"Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.","173":"For many years, forecasters could assume a modest, but stable, trend productivity growth rate and fairly predictable growth in the labor force.","174":"Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services.","175":"the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates.","176":"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply\u2013demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","177":"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated.","178":"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","179":"The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time.","180":"Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless to continue to run below 2 percent.","181":"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.","182":"We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.","183":"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity.","184":"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1\/4 percent would be appropriate.","185":"Labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of 1.4 percent per year over this period,","186":"The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.","187":"Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends.","188":"My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.","189":"For example, monetary policy makers might attempt to influence market expectations of future short rates as an alternative to changing the current setting of the overnight rate.","190":"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.","191":"Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into U. S. Treasury securities may have put downward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated monetary policy actions abroad.","192":"One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.","193":"And I need not remind you that the low inflation we now have was dearly purchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the highest interest rates since the Civil War and the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.","194":"still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was assumed to remain highly accommodative.","195":"When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent--in some cases simply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise--and debt-service obligations will move up.","196":"More subtly, my conclusion that the effects on inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the dollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the public's inflation expectations are well anchored.","197":"Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.","198":"Stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other.","199":"If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth.","200":"several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.","201":"Members also expressed concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that seemed to be gathering momentum.","202":"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor market\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markups\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.9 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","203":"Participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.","204":"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","205":"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.","206":"In any case, the real federal funds rate is now lower than prior to the easings, at the same time that the unemployment rate is lower and projected growth higher than it was prior to the easings.","207":"However, we now know that an unexpected and unrecognized slowdown in productivity growth occurred in 1973.","208":"We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don\u2019t meet the liftoff test now because we\u2019re not at maximum employment.","209":"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005","210":"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.","211":"And productivity\u2019s been very low.","212":"Relative to the average episode, commercial real estate prices neither fell much during the recession nor rose a lot during the expansion.","213":"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.","214":"Three Asset-Price-Bust Episodes Let us first examine the U.K. recession of 1974.","215":"Even with the improving labor market, I still hear from businesses that qualified workers are difficult to find, and labor shortages remain a drag on hiring and on economic growth.","216":"We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for some time, that says the Committee \u201canticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\u201d I know that\u2019s a mouthful, but it says, in effect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery difficult, we\u2019re getting beyond them.","217":"To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up our broad stock price indexes.","218":"But before I return to the prospects for 1998 and the challenges for monetary policy, I will offer a retrospective on 1997.","219":"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted\u2014inflation-indexed bonds have come down.","220":"Members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive.","221":"The first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation.","222":"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.","223":"Looking beyond the near term, the members anticipated that as the prevailing uncertainties began to diminish, the economy's resiliency abetted by broadly accommodative monetary and fiscal polices and the continuation of a strong uptrend in productivity would underpin a gradual economic recovery.","224":"For the present, however, inflation remained subdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases.","225":"Members cited greater, albeit still occasional, indications of heightened worker demands in labor negotiations that likely were encouraged in part by ample job opportunities.","226":"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","227":"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: \"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","228":"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","229":"However, the volatility of these and other commodity prices is such that possible future increases in these prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook.","230":"I\u2019m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation.","231":"It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.","232":"The major reason for these significant differences in spending out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but persistent, rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent.","233":"However, making significant use of this option would bias credit flows in the direction of depository institutions and, if the volume of these loans were large enough, could affect the interest rates on the assets, specifically bank loans held by such institutions.","234":"Productivity and TechnologyLet me now turn from the overall economic outlook to productivity and technology developments.","235":"But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footing.","236":"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.","237":"It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment.","238":"Housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing.","239":"We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries.","240":"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.","241":"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","242":"Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as required to keep inflation at bay.","243":"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","244":"About the same time, Board staff developed the so-called P* (P-star) model, based on M2, which used the quantity theory of money and estimates of long-run potential output and velocity (the ratio of nominal income to money) to predict long-run inflation trends.","245":"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","246":"Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year,","247":"An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the growth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales.","248":"In their discussion of forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, a few members suggested that lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent could effectively convey the Committee's intention to keep the target federal funds rate low for an extended period.","249":"The members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices.","250":"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.","251":"But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price.","252":"Foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter.","253":"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that\u2019s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.","254":"Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh use a similar methodology and find a range from a little less than 1-1\/2 percent to about 3 percent with a central tendency of around 2-1\/4 percent.5 These estimates are clearly plausible, but history does raise some warning flags concerning the length of time that productivity growth continues elevated.","255":"The Outlook for Economic ActivityThe midpoint of the range of projections for real GDP growth declines noticeably from about 2-1\/2 percent for 2007 to roughly 2 percent in 2008; then it returns to about 2-1\/2 percent in 2009 and 2010.","256":"Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year\u2019s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants.","257":"One objective--price stability--can be well defined and is fully under the control of monetary policymakers, at least over a period of time.","258":"Today, the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas--some that would have been familiar to the central bankers in the Fed's early years and some that would have been unfamiliar: maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets supervising and regulating banking organizations to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect consumers from harm in their use of credit and banking services playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payment system, including providing certain financial services to financial institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions conducting monetary policy in pursuit of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment We have an all-too-recent example of the Fed as a source of financial stability in its response to the financial aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred just before I joined the Board in December 2001.","259":"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.","260":"Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance of the economy.","261":"Nonetheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff anticipated that real GDP growth would not materially exceed increases in potential output in 2013.","262":"On the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap.","263":"With about $250 billion of these inflation-protected securities now outstanding, we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates.","264":"So, as I mentioned, we\u2019re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation.","265":"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","266":"A couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time.","267":"All members agreed that the FOMC statement for this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.","268":"But I think that that\u2019s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now\u2014and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it\u2019s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","269":"The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.","270":"Flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be simpler to communicate.","271":"Foreign economic growth remained sluggish, restrained by weak activity in Europe and the associated spillovers--including through trade--to the rest of the world.","272":"Although I expect these upward price pressures to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain.","273":"Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth.","274":"However, in the view of at least some members, recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation.","275":"An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain.","276":"With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","277":"So the Committee estimates that the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.","278":"In the housing sector, demand had continued to display appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.","279":"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.","280":"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think\u2014you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.","281":"Many members of the Committee, participants, have said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, which tends to be variable over time, and that\u2019s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.","282":"Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009.","283":"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","284":"Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net.","285":"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow","286":"However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels.","287":"Certainly, if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor.","288":"If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re, we\u2019re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum.","289":"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.","290":"And I\u2019ll discuss the thinking behind today\u2019s interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward.","291":"year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.","292":"In response to the resulting high inflation, the Fed was obliged to raise interest rates, and the economy weakened.","293":"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","294":"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000.","295":"Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008.","296":"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.","297":"Moreover, a 50 basis point reduction that was associated with the communication of a Committee view that the risks to achieving its objectives for economic activity were balanced might be mistakenly interpreted in the view of some members as a signal that the Committee had come to the end of its policy easing moves--a judgment they were not prepared to make at this time.","298":"The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. \"","299":"That interdependence suggests that monetary policy makers must pay attention to conditions abroad as well as at home.","300":"But you do see growth in services, so you\u2014this pattern around the world of Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference FINAL weak manufacturing","301":"That ex post relationship, the correlation between actual--instead of intended--domestic saving and domestic investment was the object of the seminal work by Feldstein and Horioka a quarter century ago.4 Without the evident worldwide fall in home bias over the past decade, noted earlier, the United States would not have been able to finance its recent current account deficits, and, accordingly, these deficits would have been smaller.","302":"Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.","303":"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate declined, reaching 4.","304":"Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable,","305":"A second economic rationale that is often advanced for the development of cities and that seems applicable to the Sioux Falls experience is that of labor market pooling--the ability of an industry to take advantage of a labor force possessing a specific set of skills, thereby raising productivity compared with competing areas with a more dispersed set of skills.","306":"In fact, applying a formal regression analysis to the full sample from 1989 to 2002, we found a number fairly close to this one, namely, a stock price multiplier for monetary policy of about 4.7.","307":"Because current inflation is affected by inflation expectations, the smaller increase in expected inflation will lead to a smaller increase in actual inflation as well.","308":"Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.","309":"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.","310":"The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in recent months was lower than the staff expected at the time of the November meeting, and the staff forecast anticipated that core PCE prices would rise a bit more slowly in 2011 and 2012 than previously projected.","311":"Participants thought that consumer expenditures likely would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters, supported by solid gains in employment and real income.","312":"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","313":"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, as investors responded to strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications that the economy may be stabilizing.","314":"The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate.","315":"Consider our estimates of real economic activity.","316":"Some participants noted that additional asset purchases could be used to provide more accommodation by lowering longer-term interest rates.","317":"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","318":"Many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable.","319":"Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.","320":"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit.","321":"With energy prices having turned down, overall consumer price inflation had eased slightly in recent months,","322":"Policymakers, economists, and market participants see much of this decline as reflecting a permanent fall in the equilibrium rate of interest\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is, the level of the federal funds rate that keeps the economy at full employment with stable inflation in the longer run.","323":"Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.","324":"Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.","325":"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","326":"Broad equity price indexes were higher over the intermeeting period, amid heightened volatility.","327":"In addition, coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability.","328":"where unemployment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September\u2014and we have made some progress since last September","329":"The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer\u2014are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation.","330":"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","331":"Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.","332":"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.","333":"In contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time.","334":"However, investor demand for high-quality commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) reportedly was robust, although issuance of CMBS remained muted.","335":"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy.","336":"these participants noted the risk that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized.","337":"also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","338":"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","339":"The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.","340":"Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate.","341":"and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.","342":"Monetary policy seeks to buffer the economy from unexpected adverse disruptions, or \"shocks.\"","343":"In discussing the increases in U. S. longer-term interest rates that occurred in the wake of the June FOMC meeting and the associated press conference, meeting participants pointed to heightened financial market uncertainty about the path of monetary policy and a shift of market expectations toward less policy accommodation.","344":"The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.","345":"If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored.","346":"Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","347":"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.","348":"Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time.","349":"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","350":"Well, we\u2014as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots.","351":"For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.","352":"The staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as similar to its normal level over the past 20 years.","353":"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.","354":"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.","355":"Last year was the fifth consecutive year that inflation, measured by the chain GDP price index, was 2.6% or lower and the 5-year compound annual inflation rate is now 2.5%, the lowest since 1967.","356":"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.","357":"Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures.","358":"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.","359":"participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term.","360":"With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw.","361":"This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.","362":"Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.","363":"Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.","364":"\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","365":"We can best promote a progressive credit climate by maintaining an environment of low inflation.","366":"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","367":"Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.","368":"While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds.","369":"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. \"","370":"I presented these estimates in my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth.","371":"A few members expressed interest in using language specifying a period of time during which the federal funds rate was expected to remain exceptionally low, rather than a calendar date, arguing that such language might be better to indicate a constant stance of monetary policy over time.","372":"The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.","373":"A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal support would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy's return to the Committee's goals of broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability.","374":"Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy.","375":"But the importance of price stability has sometimes been insufficiently appreciated in our central bank's history, and, as Allan Meltzer will soon point out, such episodes have had unfortunate consequences.","376":"U. S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year.","377":"In that vein, several participants noted that inflation expectations had been sensitive to incoming data and to communications regarding monetary policy over the intermeeting period.","378":"They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.","379":"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month.","380":"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.","381":"Participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions.","382":"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","383":"As you can see, transforming the information available from published statistics into concepts useful for assessing the consequences of monetary policy is, in fact, quite complex.","384":"Financial markets are the channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the risks around those expectations.","385":"Largely as a consequence of rapidly expanding \"new economy\" investments, gains in productivity had occurred at remarkable rates in recent years.","386":"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won\u2019t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization\u2014high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic\u2014or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","387":"Instead, an upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States.","388":"continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.","389":"A more robust contour for final sales over the forecast horizon would lead to somewhat greater pressure on resource margins, despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity, though the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time.","390":"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.","391":"But speculators rarely succeed in dislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures.","392":"These are, you know, this is\u2014this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range\u2014in the neighborhood of full employment.","393":"The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged.","394":"The members agreed that the statement to be issued after this meeting should highlight their view that even after their firming today the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation pressures.","395":"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels.","396":"The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.","397":"I shall endeavor to place this most unusual phenomenon in the context of the broader changes in our economy and, hopefully, explain why the value of education, especially to enhance advanced skills, is so vital to the future growth of our economy.","398":"and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent.","399":"Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets.","400":"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","401":"We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we\u2019re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1 So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to,","402":"The Fed's credibility, earned over decades of low inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long-term success.","403":"So I, you know, I\u2019m\u2014I feel quite comfortable that we can\u2014in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period.","404":"So, up until the first week of October 2021, the story of high inflation being temporary was holding up, and the labor market improvements had slowed but were continuing.","405":"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.","406":"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.","407":"In real terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective\u2014that\u2019s 1 percent in real terms.","408":"The key to explaining why price stability promotes stability in both output and employment is the realization that, when inflation itself is well-controlled, then the public's expectations of inflation will also be low and stable.","409":"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.","410":"There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away.","411":"Some participants also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.","412":"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated \"makeup\" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","413":"As a case in point, the increase in the transparency of U.S. monetary policy over the past two decades has been quite significant.","414":"Monetary Policy With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy.","415":"Business contacts in a number of Districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions.","416":"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.","417":"The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector.","418":"The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time.1 While last year's rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated.","419":"Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment, should it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions on consumer spending.","420":"Misconceptions about Inflation Targeting I would like to turn now, briefly, to comment on a few key misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency in the public debate.","421":"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we\u2019ll see greater growth going forward.","422":"I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.","423":"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it \"seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,\" and\u00e2\u20ac\u201din the same sentence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat therefore \"following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\"","424":"Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.","425":"One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.","426":"In response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply.","427":"The members generally agreed that, if necessary, their concerns about rising inflation could be addressed at the meeting in early February.","428":"At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008.","429":"The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.","430":"Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estimates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working-age populations are borne out.","431":"I don\u2019t think we look at\u2014I understand what you\u2019re asking, but we\u2019re looking at\u2014our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at with setting interest rates.","432":"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","433":"Overall, research indicates that trade with developing economies in particular has slowed the rate of growth of import prices faced by industrialized countries, with estimates of the reduction ranging widely from 1\/2 to 2 percentage points.","434":"Rapid responses by businesses to changes in free-market prices have muted much of the tendency for unsold goods to back up, or unmet needs to produce shortages.","435":"The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.","436":"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.","437":"Moving to such a system would require assigning monetary policy to the task of targeting exchange rates, and countries are free to do so if they wish.","438":"For a variety of reasons, oil prices already had risen appreciably since the start of the year.","439":"Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.","440":"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).","441":"the anticipated decline in the unemployment rate was somewhat slower than in the previous projection.","442":"What modern monetary policymaking has not faced for quite some time, if ever, has been a major surge in innovation--matching, if not exceeding, the other great waves this century--followed by an apparent elevation of productivity growth.","443":"And that\u2019s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.","444":"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.","445":"To do that you've got to have price stability, and we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion too.","446":"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.","447":"In addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-term rate.","448":"But, I would say, overall, we\u2019re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices.","449":"Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound.","450":"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","451":"So unless productivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.","452":"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","453":"too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.","454":"With crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014.","455":"Now, we have\u2014you know, we haven\u2019t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that\u2019s one of the main reasons why we haven\u2019t anticipated the relatively slow growth.","456":"The producer price index for core intermediate materials dropped for a fifth month in February, reflecting, in part, weaker global demand and steep declines in the prices of a wide variety of energy-intensive goods, such as chemicals and plastics.","457":"But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.","458":"The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions.","459":"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.","460":"In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations.","461":"Al\u00adthough core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","462":"In the past few years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.","463":"This action was taken against the backdrop of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the performance of the economy.","464":"It was possible, though, that investors' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects, not just inflation expectations themselves, had risen.","465":"The changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \"shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot \"deviations.\"","466":"I\u2019m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.","467":"Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.","468":"Market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low,","469":"The Role of Government Policy You will have noted that I have not mentioned the role of government policy in creating a higher rate of trend productivity growth.","470":"how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?","471":"Participants expected economic activity to contract sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in early 2009.","472":"Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.","473":"Several participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with increased trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and the effects of wet weather and severe flooding.","474":"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential.","475":"Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker.","476":"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.","477":"Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.","478":"If we adjust the 6.7 percent headline unemployment rate for the decline in participation since February and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of misclassification, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, similar to the peak following the Global Financial Crisis.","479":"Members saw the persistence of a relatively vigorous expansion in overall economic activity as a likely prospect in the context of continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative financial conditions, growing business optimism, favorable consumer sentiment, and robust increases in productivity.","480":"Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales have slowed, the continued increasing price of single-family homes indicates to me that rents won't decline anytime in the near future.","481":"Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5 She argued that \"a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs.","482":"It was suggested that the weakening expansion of expenditures in these capital goods might reflect a surfeit in capacity following a period of extraordinary growth in many industries--for example, those related to fiber optics.","483":"Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.","484":"The extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time.","485":"In terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of the past few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s.","486":"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. \"","487":"Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter.","488":"not to target asset prices (or exchange rates).","489":"And, as I think all of us\u2014having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced\u2014do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that\u2019s in place by having several interest rate increases this year.","490":"One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.","491":"Over the medium term, participants expected strong growth in employment, driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of consumer and business confidence, as well as accommodative fiscal and monetary policy.","492":"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.","493":"Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability.","494":"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.","495":"Inflation Targeting and Central Bank Behavior,\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York, mimeo.","496":"Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further advances in employment and income.","497":"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. \"","498":"Several participants noted the increase in agricultural crop prices over 2020 and the associated improvement in farm revenues.","499":"However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.","500":"Policy tightening started last year, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid expectations of accelerating inflation.","501":"Prospects for ProductivityLet me close with some comments on the outlook for productivity.","502":"That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting.","503":"So that\u2019s in the low 20s, and that\u2019s post the May employment report.","504":"Price shocks.","505":"A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth.","506":"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1\/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","507":"On the supply side, the effect is fairly clear and immediate: An increase in trend productivity growth implies a more rapid pace of growth of the economy's productive capacity.","508":"Most participants continued to see the risks to inflation as balanced.","509":"It was observed that, after the early 1980s, the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation had been quite limited, suggesting that, in current circumstances, core inflation could stay relatively low and overall inflation would probably drop back if inflation expectations remained contained.","510":"Particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations along with the risks to the U. S. outlook associated with global economic developments, he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help re-center inflation and inflation expectations at levels consistent with the Committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and simultaneously provide some insurance against unexpected developments that could slow U. S. economic growth.","511":"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.","512":"This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts for a small part of the forecast error on inflation.","513":"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.","514":"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter.","515":"One participant remarked that, with inflation having run consistently below 2 percent in recent years and market-based measures of inflation compensation still low, postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would help push inflation expectations up to levels consistent with the Committee's objective.","516":"Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability.","517":"So it\u2019s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.","518":"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","519":"So that\u2019s the kind of thinking we\u2019ll be doing, and, again, we\u2019re looking\u2014ultimately, we\u2019re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.","520":"The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.","521":"Consequently, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.","522":"For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.","523":"So there\u2019s been a number of emerging markets\u2014as you know, we\u2019re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that are affecting their economic activity.","524":"It was the year of synchronized global growth.","525":"Indicators for China in July pointed to only a modest slowing of output growth from its torrid pace in the first half of the year.","526":"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the\u2014by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we\u2019ve learned\u2014as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn\u2019t really reacted.","527":"* * * As the transcripts of FOMC meetings attest, making monetary policy is an especially humbling activity.","528":"With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023.","529":"Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening.","530":"In essence, monetary credibility helps the central bank do its job, by inducing private sector participants also to take actions that help achieve the central bank's low inflation objective.","531":"We also said we wouldn\u2019t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.","532":"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.","533":"The members also agreed on the desirability of retaining the assessment that the risks with regard to the outlook for economic growth were balanced.","534":"In part, the high inflation reflects supply chain disruptions associated with the economic effects of the pandemic and efforts made to contain it.","535":"In the absence of such offsetting operations, a decrease in currency demand would raise the amount of reserves and hence lower the federal funds rate.","536":"Some business contacts indicated that wage and price pressures were subdued; however, in one District, contacts pointed to rising wage pressures and labor shortages.","537":"They also agreed that the inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be shown.","538":"One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors.","539":"So it\u2019s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic.","540":"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years.","541":"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices; core CPI inflation remained low.","542":"Without the accompanying boost to productivity, our progress toward price stability might well have been marked by the social pressures that arose in many previous episodes of disinflation both here and abroad.","543":"The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending.","544":"Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack.","545":"Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.","546":"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.","547":"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.","548":"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","549":"Nonetheless, the members also noted that the rise in compensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be few indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and anecdotal information available at this time; such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.","550":"Even so, most members viewed a slowing to a rate closer to most estimates of the growth of the economy's potential as a reasonable expectation.","551":"Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time.","552":"Of course, we\u2019re ready to provide information that Congress needs to evaluate the Fed\u2019s decisionmaking, in monetary policy and elsewhere.","553":"With an increase in the target range at this meeting, the federal funds rate would be at or close to the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run neutral interest rate, and participants expressed that recent developments, including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth, made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier.","554":"We all saw the remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market.","555":"It isn\u2019t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it\u2019s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.","556":"Most participants continued to think that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.","557":"To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels.","558":"Increased rates and a smaller balance sheet raise the cost of borrowing and thus reduce household and business demand.","559":"We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation.","560":"Some members expressed a concern that in this context any further adverse shocks could have disproportionate effects, resulting in a significant slowing in growth going forward.","561":"If episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence are integral to the way our economy and our financial markets work now and in the future, it has significant implications for risk management and, by implication, macroeconomic modeling and monetary policy.","562":"The staff's forecast for core PCE price inflation this year was revised down a little in response to recent data.","563":"The effect of a productivity slowdown on employment growth is likewise ambiguous in the medium term.","564":"So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works.","565":"The resulting uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the future path of activity, unemployment, and inflation.","566":"The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there.","567":"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.","568":"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.","569":"Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a perceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the economy more generally.","570":"Inflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods.","571":"Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight.","572":"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications.","573":"Case studies of individual industries show that, in some cases, the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.","574":"And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend.","575":"Assisted by the whole array of market prices, entrepreneurs seek to identify the types of products and services that individuals will value, especially the added value placed on products and services that customers find better tailored to their particular needs, delivered in shorter time frames, or improved in quality.","576":"Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports.","577":"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.","578":"Participants agreed to continue to explore ways to increase transparency and clarity in the Committee's policy communications, and they indicated a willingness to look into modifications to the SEP. At the end of the discussion, the Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to explore potential approaches to providing more information about the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy through the SEP.","579":"On the more positive side, there were no signs that the pace of productivity gains was currently leveling out and no evidence of rising longer-term inflation expectations.","580":"On the other hand, by that metric, the, the September 16, 2020 unemployment rate would have been in the\u2014in the 20s in, in April.","581":"It was also noted that the weakness in homebuilding along with the continued rise in house prices suggested that supply constraints were also weighing on construction activity.","582":"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.","583":"Although many participants remained concerned about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced.","584":"An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.","585":"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","586":"Participants' assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually.","587":"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","588":"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.","589":"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.","590":"Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the consumer price index.","591":"The ebbing of stimulus from last year's tax cuts also could tend to slow growth in consumer spending.","592":"I did indicate that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.","593":"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","594":"In response to an unanticipated movement in spending and hence the quantity of money demanded, a small variation in interest rates would be sufficient to bring money back to path but not to correct the deviation in spending.","595":"Following the deepest plunge since the Great Depression, employment and activity rebounded faster and more sharply than anticipated.","596":"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997.","597":"So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so.","598":"Additionally, by depressing perceived rates of return abroad, the weakness in foreign demand explains a considerable portion of the run-up in the dollar, as shown in figure 4.","599":"Many noted that the slowdown could be a temporary aberration and that other labor market indicators--such as new claims for unemployment insurance, the rate of job openings, and readings on consumers' perceptions of the labor market--remained positive.","600":"One prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior; another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy.","601":"A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.","602":"So, I think you raise a very important point because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to matter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest rates will look like.","603":"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.","604":"In the absence of such shocks, and assuming appropriate monetary policy, participants' economic projections generally showed growth picking up to a moderate pace and the unemployment rate declining somewhat next year.","605":"Private investors would have to hold more longer-term securities as the Federal Reserve's holdings ran off, making longer-term interest rates somewhat higher than they would be otherwise.","606":"They also generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.","607":"Significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year; sustained outsized gains in productivity could further damp hiring.","608":"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.","609":"The FOMC's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.","610":"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.","611":"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection.","612":"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework the Federal Reserve unanimously adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.2 Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At FOMC meetings convened since the new framework was announced last August, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases to bring it in line with our new framework.","613":"Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.","614":"Japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s.","615":"Members still saw the economic expansion continuing, and most believed that inflation was likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward levels they consider more consistent with the Committee's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.","616":"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","617":"In the course of the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that there was no persuasive evidence in recent statistical measures that price inflation was currently picking up or that inflation expectations were rising, though the declines in both inflation and expectations experienced over the course of recent years no longer seemed to be occurring.","618":"The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months.","619":"We also do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.","620":"After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?","621":"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.","622":"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","623":"In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.","624":"To provide some evidence for this assertion, as well as some reasons for it, I draw your attention to a speech that Chairman Greenspan made earlier this year, entitled \"Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy\" (Greenspan, 2004).","625":"The latter could well be augmented by sharply rising medical costs and by attempts to protect the purchasing power of wages from the erosion caused by the rise in energy prices.","626":"So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the\u2014the net effects of this will be to\u2014to have inflation move down even a little bit more.","627":"However, given the difficulty in distinguishing between changes in asset prices dominated by fundamental forces and those driven by non-fundamental forces, policymakers should not target asset prices or try to guide them to the policymakers' estimate of fundamental value.","628":"Since June, however, inflation fears have receded, and some financial-market participants have become less optimistic about the economy's near-term growth prospects.","629":"The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.","630":"The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains.","631":"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","632":"In that regard, the changes in the macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review may have some implications for financial stability.","633":"Implications of Economic Theory I am going to assert some conclusions based on economic theory that help to understand the potential for monetary policy to achieve these objectives and the consistency among them.","634":"A few members observed that, in their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions--including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the Committee's objective--could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long.","635":"Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP growth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983.","636":"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there\u2019ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.","637":"And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.","638":"Notably, if people feel sure that inflation will remain well controlled, they will be more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior, which (in something of a virtuous circle) makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to confirm their expectations by keeping inflation low.","639":"That\u2019s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability.","640":"In fact, the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming Community Affairs Research Conference will feature several papers that explore these issues.5 Homeownership The important issue of loan pricing aside, expanded access to mortgage credit has helped fuel substantial growth in homeownership.","641":"We\u2019re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us\u2014that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent\u2014on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","642":"The invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity.","643":"Actual or realized saving depends on the equilibrium values of the real interest rate and other economic variables.","644":"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.","645":"Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher.","646":"Economic DevelopmentsReal economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.","647":"The Federal Reserve\u2019s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.","648":"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.","649":"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.","650":"In recent years, aggressive cost-cutting in the United States has been linked to greater emphasis on maximization of shareholder value and less on growth and diversification, which was more prominent in the 1970s and 1980s.","651":"Whether one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future returns.","652":"The high oil prices would themselves cut into demand growth and tend to stabilize the system.","653":"The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. \"","654":"The course of underlying inflation pressures was more difficult to gauge, however.","655":"Some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that I have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.","656":"Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.","657":"If a range is selected, questions will arise about the differing implications of movements of inflation inside the range and outside the range and, in the absence of explicitly identifying the mid-point as the target, about where within the range policymakers would prefer inflation to gravitate.","658":"Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.","659":"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.","660":"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.","661":"Financing conditions in capital markets remained broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations.","662":"Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.","663":"The bulk of the variation comes from what finance academics call \"changes in discount rates,\" which is a fancy way of saying the non-fundamental stuff that we don't understand very well--and which can include changes in either investor sentiment or risk aversion, price movements due to forced selling by either levered investors or convexity hedgers, and a variety of other effects that fall under the broad heading of internal market dynamics.","664":"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?","665":"Because equity valuations may pose asymmetric risks to the economic forecast, the implied optimal responses of policy to changes in asset prices may be nonlinear.","666":"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","667":"Productivity accelerated.","668":"Similarly, measures of underlying inflation continued to be somewhat low relative to levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the longer run.","669":"As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run.","670":"Independence and the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve, created in 1913, was established as an independent central bank--although, at the time, it was given no clear concept of its role in the conduct of monetary policy.","671":"Obviously, productivity growth generated through this rationalization process will not have the direct demand-augmenting effect of productivity increases realized through more rapid investment spending.","672":"Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.","673":"This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.","674":"\"4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy.","675":"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.","676":"Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins.","677":"Still, most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives.","678":"The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, inflation is close to our 2 percent objective, gross domestic product growth is solid, and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) baseline outlook is for a continuation of this performance in 2020.2 At present, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation is running somewhat below our 2 percent objective, but we project that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation will rise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.","679":"Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously.","680":"Comparing the Theoretical Prediction to Recent Experience The swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when the fiscal year 1994 budget was adopted.","681":"But it\u2019s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.","682":"This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth.","683":"Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets.","684":"Money versus Interest Rates For most of the post-World War II period, monetary economists have vigorously debated whether the Fed should target money or interest rates in setting policy.","685":"The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. \"","686":"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","687":"An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.","688":"Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, in part reflecting lower energy prices.","689":"With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997.","690":"On balance, while the business investment outlook seemed vulnerable to somewhat greater than projected weakness in the short run, the members were persuaded that, against the background of large continuing gains in structural productivity and cost savings from further investment in equipment and software, business firms were likely to accelerate their spending for new capital after a period of adjustment.","691":"Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know\u2014our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they\u2019re under stress, and that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s really part of what we did today.","692":"In the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up in the absence of policy action.","693":"In contrast, the rise in oil prices during the 1970s was probably seen at the time as largely reflecting a permanent shift in global demand\/supply balances.","694":"Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates.","695":"And we\u2019re learning to, to engage in economic activity.","696":"One of the things we\u2019ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that, very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn\u2019t pick up to pre-recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy, which is called \u201chysteresis.\u201d And I raised the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.","697":"When the government runs deficits, it siphons off private savings (reducing national saving), leaving less available for capital investment.","698":"The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.","699":"The labor market improved in August, and the unemployment rate edged down to 5.","700":"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2013 and over the longer run.","701":"Participants continued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors waned and labor market conditions strengthened further, inflation would stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.","702":"We want to see lower unemployment.","703":"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.","704":"Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.","705":"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt, GSE-guaranteed MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","706":"Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.","707":"With capacity utilization already at high levels, relatively rapid growth in inventory investment, if it were superimposed on stronger-than- projected expansion in final demand, could portend serious pressures on resources and inflationary consequences for the economy.","708":"If we\u2014if we analyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory influences are holding down inflation, I do not want to say that we would respond to that.","709":"Participants pointed to potential interactions between financial stresses and the housing market contraction as the primary source of continuing downside risks to growth.","710":"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.","711":"However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization.","712":"Such second-round effects are likely to be quite limited as long as the rise in the relative price of energy does not lead to a rise in long-run inflation expectations, as has largely been the case in the recent period (figure 1).","713":"Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.","714":"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1\u00bd percent.","715":"However, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.","716":"Headline stock price indexes in the AFEs generally ended the period higher, whereas bank stocks in Europe declined.","717":"Those few members who expressed a preference for easing at this meeting believed that, with unit labor costs and inflation expectations contained, enough evidence of further weakness already existed to warrant an immediate action.","718":"Indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident.","719":"Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.","720":"Some of the increase in sentiment and changes in asset prices could be tied to expectations of more expansive fiscal policy, another upside risk.","721":"Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, although several members were concerned about downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation.","722":"This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term.","723":"The benefits achieved through more-stable prices are substantial.","724":"Moreover, if declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing.","725":"The shifting balance of domestic demand and potential supply in each country means that policies affecting domestic demand will need to be re-calibrated to preserve price stability and keep economies operating at high levels of reserve utilization.","726":"For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late.","727":"That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good\u2014in some dimensions\u2014labor market without having to worry about inflation.","728":"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.","729":"When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee\u2019s judgment, it\u2019s very possible that the inflation test will already be met.","730":"Many participants commented that measures of short-term inflation expectations were elevated or that far-forward measures of inflation compensation were near the upper edge of their historical range.","731":"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.","732":"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment.","733":"Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago.","734":"In the past, a reasonable goal might have been to maintain a zero deficit in our on-budget accounts--those accounts that exclude the Social Security and Medicare surplus--and to begin a serious discussion of reforms to Social Security and Medicare to bring them closer into actuarial balance.","735":"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.","736":"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers.","737":"Household spending stepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July, the strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and distribution of additional fiscal support.","738":"Just as in the earlier analysis of Ammer and Freeman, this analysis suggested that in all three countries the inflation targeting led to a drop in inflation and nominal interest rates.","739":"This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions.","740":"Although not without some serious shortcomings, the published productivity data provide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth.","741":"That is a positive for growth.","742":"In addition, the maximum sustainable levels of output and employment cannot be known with any assurance (Mishkin, 2007b).","743":"You know, it\u2019s interest rates, it\u2019s risk spreads, it\u2019s currency, it\u2019s the stock market, it\u2019s credit availability, it\u2019s many, many factors.","744":"\"4 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmaximum employment and price stability\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich remain unchanged.5 Concluding Remarks While economic recovery since the spring collapse has been robust, let us not forget that full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go.","745":"Furthermore, policymakers hoped that additional tools at their disposal--so-called incomes policies enforced by \u201cjawboning,\u201d guideposts, and price and wage controls--were ready to combat and control any resulting upcreep in inflation with minimal macroeconomic cost.","746":"This equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers.","747":"In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.","748":"For example, for 2003 as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP.","749":"In a virtuous circle, stable inflation expectations help the central bank to keep inflation low even as it retains substantial freedom to respond to disturbances to the broader economy.","750":"I mean, we\u2014the\u2014again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak.","751":"However, given the good pace of economic expansion since then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment.","752":"The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate.","753":"We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don\u2019t change rapidly.","754":"In Japan, private consumption rebounded strongly, and private investment and net exports continued to boost growth.","755":"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","756":"It\u2019s where we always want inflation to be heading.","757":"In the textbook world of Mundell-Fleming, unanticipated monetary ease leads to lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports.","758":"Microeconomic studies provide corroborating information to the macroeconomic evidence of a post-1995 acceleration in productivity growth.","759":"Most Committee members, while acknowledging the deficiencies of structural models, viewed them as useful in their efforts to understand how the inflation process was changing and also as input to inflation forecasts.","760":"Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.","761":"The second is intermediate-term need for reserve expansion and contraction, arising, for example, from seasonal changes in the demand for currency and reserves.","762":"Alternatively, monetary policy could convert the temporary disinflationary effect into a permanent one.","763":"As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilled workers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages, or become unemployed.","764":"The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.","765":"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants\u2019 assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth\u2014for growth in the global economy outside the United States\u2014and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.","766":"So, you know, I can\u2019t\u2014all I can tell you is, we\u2019ll be looking at weak global growth.","767":"After the stock-market decline that began in March 2000, new capital investment and thus the demand for financing waned around the world.","768":"What I\u2019m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate.","769":"Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.","770":"Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.","771":"In their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports.","772":"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","773":"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization.","774":"The implication is that trend productivity and, ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected.","775":"In the absence of such a forward-looking response of long-term rates, short-term interest rates may have to move by more to achieve the same near-term impact on long-term interest rates and economic activity.","776":"Core measures of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly so over the last few months.","777":"Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten further and inflation pressures build.","778":"For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in core PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation.","779":"As you may know, the interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.","780":"Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April\u2013May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.","781":"This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained.","782":"In my comments today, I will focus on the Fed's efforts to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals amid this upheaval, and suggest how lessons from history and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance for today's unique monetary policy challenges.","783":"For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2003) have used modern financial theory to construct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key interest rates.","784":"The external sector was projected to continue to support domestic economic activity throughout the forecast period.","785":"It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation.","786":"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.","787":"And then, what the statement emphasizes, and this is the same language we used in December and January, we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective.","788":"Nonetheless, participants generally saw the unemployment rate as still elevated and were not yet confident that the recent progress toward the Committee's employment objective would be sustained.","789":"M2 and M3 have posted very large gains in recent months, reflecting the effects of recent System easing actions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt.","790":"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","791":"We take the level of the stock market into account when we consider the economic outlook and monetary policy.","792":"Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3\/4 to 2-1\/4 percent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices.","793":"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","794":"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.","795":"Thus, avoiding a further substantial fall in inflation should be a priority of monetary policy.","796":"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: \"The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.","797":"And, and that\u2019s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework.","798":"Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.","799":"In addition, the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent.","800":"Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.","801":"Consumer price inflation had remained relatively subdued over the summer months.","802":"Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting.","803":"But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.","804":"With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, participants expected inflation to return to the Committee's 2 percent objective over time and the labor market to remain strong.","805":"The increase over the last few months in five-year measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury nominal and inflation-indexed securities might be a warning sign that expectations were not as well anchored as they had been over the summer.","806":"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","807":"While these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity.","808":"Indeed, over the past century, by far the smallest part of the growth in America's real gross domestic product reflects increased physical product measured in bulk or weight.","809":"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting.3 In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.","810":"To do this will demand not only greater specialized knowledge, but also an ability to deal with risk and uncertainty.","811":"So you\u2019re right, you\u2019re seeing\u2014I, I can\u2019t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s\u20143, 3\u00bd percent growth for next year.","812":"The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases, but PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end of this year.","813":"By the way, we\u2019re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.","814":"Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes, and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.","815":"The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.","816":"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or \"anchor,\" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","817":"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the \"Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery\" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it can\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand cannot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dreveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth Delphic and Odyssean\u00e2\u20ac\u201don the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.","818":"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.","819":"From a low near $30 per barrel in late 2003, the price of oil rose to $70 per barrel by the middle of 2006, and it has stayed high, with the current price more than $80.","820":"Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.","821":"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.","822":"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","823":"Higher productivity growth has apparently increased aggregate demand through at least three channels.","824":"However, in the view of most members, the outlook for both economic activity and price pressures remained very uncertain, and thus the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was quite unclear.","825":"Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment.","826":"Net exports subtracted more than 1\/2 percentage point from GDP growth in both 2014 and 2015, while falling non-oil import prices likely subtracted 1\/4 percentage point from the annual rate of core inflation.10 Finally, the trajectory of federal government debt relative to GDP and views regarding the debt's sustainability can also influence the effects of fiscal policy.","827":"On balance over the intermeeting period, interest rates on private instruments registered small mixed changes while yields on longer-term Treasury securities declined significantly.","828":"These policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation, including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on economic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability.","829":"And those don\u2019t\u2014those, frankly, don\u2019t carry significant implications in the long run for the\u2014for inflation or for the American economy.","830":"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months.","831":"However, with tightening resource constraints indicating unsustainable growth, only tentative signs that growth might be slowing, and various factors that had been damping prices now turning around, all the members agreed on the need for a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy.","832":"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.","833":"On average, over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age women with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving had increased by 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for men the fraction had increased by about 0.6 percentage point.5 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for prime\u00e2\u20ac\u2018age women could have scarring effects, with longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.6 Roughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the pre-COVID level is concentrated in service-providing industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality.","834":"In 1951, the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord freed the Fed from the obligation to support Treasury bond prices.","835":"But I continue to believe that the underlying rate inflation in the U.S. economy is hovering close to our 2 percent longer-run objective and, thus, that the unwelcome surge in inflation this year, once these relative price adjustments are complete and bottlenecks have unclogged, will in the end prove to be largely transitory.","836":"We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot a happy story.","837":"So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it\u2019s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.","838":"Yet as research has repeatedly demonstrated, these sorts of fundamentals only explain a small part of the variation in the prices of assets such as equities, long-term Treasury securities, and corporate bonds.","839":"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.","840":"Investor perceptions of a somewhat less accommodative tone of Federal Reserve communications, as well as the softer-than-expected reading for the April CPI, likely contributed to the decline in inflation compensation.","841":"Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","842":"Given the pressure of a considerable amount of unused resources, any adverse developments that held down economic expansion would increase the probability of further disinflation.","843":"When long-term rates rise in response to a cyclical strengthening, it reflects, in large part, the expectation of higher short-term interest rates.","844":"We include these types of price terms today in our forecasting equations, and they are important to forming our views of the inflation outlook and thus to the policy process.","845":"And we\u2019ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.","846":"But that has not\u2014what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.","847":"Consumer prices had edged up in recent months, but year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.","848":"They noted that economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation.","849":"Required down payments, usually about half of the home's purchase price, excluded many households from the market.","850":"Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities declined over the intermeeting period while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities were roughly unchanged, which left inflation compensation noticeably lower.","851":"More specifically, we observed financial-market developments over the period beginning fifteen minutes before and ending forty-five minutes after each policy decision became known to the public.4 The advantage of restricting the analysis to a short period spanning the Committee's decision is that the changes in yields or asset prices occurring within that narrow window are more likely to reflect the impact of the decision, as opposed to the arrival of other information about the economy.","852":"Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn.","853":"And, of course, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, the unemployment rate, at 13.3 percent, remains historically high.","854":"But strong demand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed.","855":"With inventories lower, firms were beginning to raise production to meet at least a portion of increased demand, and this adjustment was expected to make an important contribution to economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the year and, to a lesser extent, in 2010 as well.","856":"Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.","857":"Housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions.","858":"However, a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation consistently running below the Committee's 2 percent objective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have slipped below levels consistent with that objective.","859":"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to widespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to statistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation.","860":"The events of the last two years come on top of a huge expansion of global trade, competition and productive capacity--all of which have given American businesses less control over prices in the face of rising costs and benefited American consumers through low prices.","861":"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.","862":"These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation.","863":"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections As a follow-up to the FOMC's discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).","864":"Through our business contacts, we continue to hear stories about bottlenecks at almost every stage of production and distribution\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor example, plants that shut down because of a shortage of one or more crucial inputs; a poor cotton crop in the United States due to weather, which is driving up prices; and clogged ports and trucker shortages.","865":"In contrast, a few participants cautioned that, despite increases in market-based measures of inflation compensation in recent months and the stabilization of some survey measures of inflation expectations, the levels of these indicators remained too low to be consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","866":"The federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of unexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August.","867":"The upswing in M2 growth since late winter stemmed in part from the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing, which boosted liquid deposits over this period, though M2 was also buoyed by strong gains in nominal income.","868":"Fiscal policy, on the other hand, can be an instrument of growth policy, through its effect on national saving via the structural budget deficit, through incentive effects on work, saving and investment via tax rates and tax structure, and through public investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.","869":"Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.","870":"The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.","871":"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?","872":"However, equity prices subsequently retraced some of the earlier declines as concerns about trade policy seemed to ease and corporate earnings reports for the first quarter of 2018 generally came in stronger than expected.","873":"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.","874":"These concerns were centered around the fact that corporate borrowers could no longer raise funds in the bond or commercial paper markets at reasonable prices or, at some times and for some borrowers, at all.","875":"But in our new century, the simple notion of price has turned decidedly ambiguous.","876":"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.","877":"Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net.","878":"A few participants particularly stressed the high uncertainty associated with the expected future path of the unemployment rate and commented that the unemployment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast.","879":"All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern.","880":"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.","881":"To quantify the importance of the shift in the balance of demand and supply and of the consequent change in the term premium, we can appeal to the research literature on the term structure of interest rates.","882":"The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on inflation, so we shouldn\u2019t overblow how large that is.","883":"That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because, presumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that.","884":"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.","885":"However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year.","886":"The logic goes as follows: Easier monetary policy, for example, raises stock prices.","887":"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","888":"In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged, while wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.","889":"Progress at Home and Abroad Over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity both at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from abroad was considerable.","890":"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the challenge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.","891":"Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending.","892":"Moreover, the resulting robust gains in labor productivity have been well ahead of compensation growth and have dramatically boosted corporate profits.","893":"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.","894":"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.","895":"The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.","896":"The entire Committee is committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective over the December 16, 2015 medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn\u2019t persist at levels above our Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective.","897":"Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.","898":"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.","899":"Participants' Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.","900":"The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending.","901":"Subsequent to monetary union, harmonized consumer prices can be used as the best available measure of inflation in the Euro area.","902":"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.","903":"Nonetheless, participants noted a risk that the drop-back in inflation could be slower or more limited than the Committee would find desirable since resource utilization was currently tight and the pickup in price increases had been broadly based rather than being limited to a few specific sectors that could be linked to energy costs.","904":"Moreover, many members saw some risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later.","905":"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","906":"I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.","907":"After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs.","908":"To the extent that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop in domestic demand.","909":"Continued gains in employment and income, high household net worth, and low gasoline prices were viewed as factors that should support consumer spending in coming months.","910":"The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as well as in the reverse direction.","911":"Surveys indicated that households\u2019 expectations of inflation over the next year were little changed in February while households\u2019 and professional forecasters\u2019 longer-term inflation expectations edged lower.","912":"Many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.","913":"Moreover, it was difficult to anticipate how much the higher food and energy prices might affect inflation expectations and wage demands and thereby potentially become embedded more generally in the price structure.","914":"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below the rapid pace in the first half of last year, and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level.","915":"A variety of indicators, along with anecdotal reports, suggested that employment was expanding at a fairly good pace and labor compensation was rising moderately.","916":"Perhaps because those asset prices are important to spending, key macroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, exhibit a similar pattern.","917":"The implication is that monetary policy is already well positioned to slow the expansion.","918":"More information might provide a better sense of how the higher interest rates were affecting aggregate demand and perhaps also help--to a small degree--to shed light on the considerable uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to inflation.","919":"The steepening of the yield curve was due mostly to sharply lower short- and intermediate-term forward rates, consistent with investors' apparently more pessimistic outlook for economic growth.","920":"But this belief will persist only as long as we on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to ratify the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations that inflation will remain low and stable.","921":"In particular, the Committee noted that it would respond as necessary to maintain price stability.","922":"To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation.","923":"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","924":"While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects, the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.","925":"Job growth last month was fairly widespread, although heavy hiring in the construction sector was due partly to efforts to repair damage from the four hurricanes that hit the southeastern states.","926":"But what does this mean for monetary policy?","927":"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.","928":"In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices.","929":"A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.","930":"Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months.","931":"The recent rebound in oil prices contributed to a strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso.","932":"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.","933":"However, some participants indicated that underlying inflation remained subdued; that longer-term inflation expectations were likely to remain anchored, partly because modest changes in labor costs would constrain inflation trends; and that given the downside risks to economic growth, an early exit could unnecessarily damp the ongoing economic recovery.","934":"The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.","935":"In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment.","936":"First, insofar as recent productivity growth is concerned, I have a serious question about the quality of the data that we employ to measure output in today's economy.","937":"A few observed that the combination of recent labor market improvements and continued softness in inflation had led them to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.","938":"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","939":"In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.","940":"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members gave considerable attention to the somewhat faster increases in broad price measures over the past year, but they differed to some extent regarding the prospects for further increases in inflation.","941":"The staff interpreted the increases in prices of energy and nonmarket services that recently boosted consumer price inflation as largely transitory.","942":"White-collar, high-skilled employment increased at a much faster rate than employment in the other categories in nearly all cases in the G-7 countries over 1979-95.","943":"In Latin America, indicators suggested that economic activity in Mexico and Brazil expanded further in the first quarter.","944":"The corresponding depreciation in other countries currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports, compared to the prices of foreign produced goods.","945":"The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands.","946":"Participants generally agreed that the drag on U. S. economic activity from the appreciation of the dollar since the summer of 2014 and the slowdown in foreign economic growth, particularly in emerging market economies, was likely to continue to depress U. S. net exports for some time.","947":"Current Economic Situation and Outlook While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy.","948":"The explanations included a decline in inflation risk premiums, possibly reflecting a lower perceived probability of higher inflation outcomes; and special factors, including liquidity risk premiums, that might be influencing the pricing of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation derivatives.","949":"You know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re\u2014inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.","950":"By 2009, the forecasts for both the headline and core PCE price indexes showed inflation receding from its 2008 level, in line with the previous forecasts.","951":"This information helps Committee members deduce how their own actions and statements are likely to affect asset prices and yields.","952":"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained.","953":"At the same time, an acceleration in productivity also appears to have a direct disinflationary effect.","954":"There\u2019s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on.","955":"In the September Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), dealers indicated, on net, that they loosened credit terms applicable to several important classes of counterparties and types of collateral over the past three months amid increased demand for funding for most types of securities covered in the survey.","956":"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.","957":"The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.","958":"In addition, the forecast for headline PCE price inflation incorporated a much higher rate of increase for energy prices for the first half of the year; as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.","959":"This linkage establishes one important connection between the FOMC's target funds rate and interest rates more broadly.","960":"Another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.","961":"Rather, it is that the underlying sources of productivity growth are very complex.","962":"This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it.","963":"For equities, a stock's price-earnings ratio is a standard benchmark for assessing valuation.","964":"Flexible inflation averaging would bring some of the benefits of a formal average-inflation-targeting rule, but it could be more robust and simpler to communicate and implement.","965":"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.","966":"The unemployment rate declined in May and , 2020 June but, at 11.1 percent, remains far above its level before the outbreak and greater than the Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference FINAL peak during the Global Financial Crisis.","967":"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates but also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","968":"In the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and the pound weakened against the dollar in response to weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward revision by the Bank of England, at its early February policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack in the labor market.","969":"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.","970":"In addition to the headwinds facing demand, there could be persistent effects on the supply side of the economy.","971":"Other economies, such as Argentina and Hong Kong, have fixed their exchange rates essentially through currency boards.","972":"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity likely would start to turn up early in 2002 as inventory liquidation tapered off, and would gather strength only gradually.","973":"Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically high levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the strong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very large cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of recent years.","974":"It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve.","975":"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon.","976":"Sargent, T. \"Discussion of 'Policy Rules for Open Economics' by Lawrence Ball,\" in J.B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules.","977":"As always, each participant\u2019s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.","978":"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.","979":"Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid-June; the reactions of many states and localities in slowing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, especially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a deceleration in economic activity.","980":"In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.","981":"The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward, and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources.","982":"In fact, it\u2019s already\u2014it\u2019s already understood, I think, that\u2014that there\u2019s more\u2014even though we\u2019re at 3\u00bd percent unemployment, there\u2019s actually more slack out there, in a sense.","983":"Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.","984":"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average, with exports falling sharply and imports rising strongly.","985":"But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to.","986":"In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, members agreed that although forecasts of more moderate growth in aggregate demand at a pace around potential output had substantially reduced the odds on rising inflation, the risks still were pointed in that direction on balance.","987":"The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.","988":"Looking ahead, however, members reiterated earlier concerns that aggregate demand could continue to grow faster than potential aggregate supply, even under optimistic assumptions regarding future productivity gains.","989":"House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer.","990":"From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitment to contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raising inflation, and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability.","991":"Members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.","992":"But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since 1990, the net external debt is now 25 percent of GDP and rising sharply.","993":"And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.","994":"Workers in the lowest-wage quartile face an extremely elevated rate of unemployment of around 23 percent.7 The advent of widespread vaccinations should revive in-person schooling and childcare along with demand for the in-person services that employ a significant fraction of the lower-wage workforce.","995":"Market sentiment toward the syndicated leveraged loan market also improved, with the average bid price increasing noticeably and bid-asked spreads narrowing a bit further.","996":"If the FOMC were to tie mechanically our actions to market prices, then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whatever whim that currently struck investors' fancy.","997":"The first area is the characterization of good monetary policy in increasingly realistic and complex model environments.","998":"After falling steeply before the August FOMC meeting, emerging market equity prices were little changed, on net, over the period.","999":"You might ask: Does successful monetary policymaking really require all this additional knowledge?","1000":"The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy One of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in global sovereign bond yields.","1001":"Members again mentioned concerns on the part of business contacts regarding the adverse economic implications of very large deficits for the economy over the longer term.","1002":"Participants generally expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's objective of maximum employment.","1003":"While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism.","1004":"First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally.","1005":"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation.","1006":"Productivity change for this output concept has increased even more than for traditional concepts.","1007":"However, some participants noted that the recent rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as increases in import prices stemming from the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, could boost inflation pressures.","1008":"Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low.","1009":"These rates of growth were associated with ranges for the civilian rate of unemployment of 5-1\/4 to 5-1\/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 5 to 5-1\/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.","1010":"In their discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence in the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, all the members agreed that the latter should continue to express, as it had for every meeting earlier this year, their belief that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation.","1011":"An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you\u2019re reaching those points.","1012":"They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.","1013":"Even as the outlook for real activity has weakened, there have been some important developments on the inflation front.","1014":"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid misguided actions that will provoke unintended consequences.","1015":"Such increases in productivity along with slack in foreign economies contributed to the very strong competition in most markets that was continuing generally to suppress efforts to raise prices.","1016":"Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy.","1017":"On the one hand, an inverted yield curve could indicate an increased risk of recession; on the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent years--reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases--could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity.","1018":"In terms of missing on inflation, policymakers' projections looked very much like most of the public's.","1019":"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think\u2014I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.","1020":"About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015.","1021":"But even for many other workers, a rapidly evolving work environment in which the skill demands of their jobs are changing can lead to very real anxiety and insecurity about losing their jobs.","1022":"Some participants suggested that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the impact of structural factors, including mismatches between the skills of the unemployed and the skills demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available.","1023":"Participants commented that an increase in inflation from recent rates could have especially adverse effects on longer-run economic performance.","1024":"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.","1025":"In 2019, sluggish growth abroad and global developments weighed on investment, exports, and manufacturing in the United States, although there are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate.","1026":"Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we inform everyone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates.","1027":"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than\u2014perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment\u2014lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level\u2014the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.","1028":"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.","1029":"The first question is whether the degree of easing implemented in response to financial market turbulence and the abrupt downward revision in the forecast should be reassessed in light of the subsequent improvement in financial conditions and the continued robustness of domestic demand.","1030":"It also requires that policy tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential, not only because output stabilization is a policy objective in its own right but also because such actions help to head off undesirable changes in inflation down the road.","1031":"Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.","1032":"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach.","1033":"Participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually.","1034":"However, some others emphasized that deferring the decision until later in the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation.","1035":"In the absence of legislation, going appreciably further in the direction of prioritizing price stability, as would be implied by a numerical target that was expected to be achieved most of the time, would be potentially damaging to the democratic balance and would risk a backlash.","1036":"If this high-pressure management inadvertently carried the economy beyond its productive potential, some cost in terms of inflation could be expected, but such costs appeared tolerable in light of the employment gains that came with them.","1037":"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supply\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding labor supply\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.","1038":"However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm.","1039":"So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.","1040":"In particular, the unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas of South Dakota have consistently been lower than in rural areas, and this relative abundance of job opportunities has tended to encourage migration to areas such as Sioux Falls.","1041":"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context.","1042":"They remarked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed.","1043":"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.","1044":"Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of Figure 1 is an estimate of market inflation expectations over the next five years, and the upper line represents five-year forward expectations of inflation, that is, today's expectation of what average inflation will be between 2009 and 2014.","1045":"The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.","1046":"It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum-employment mandate.","1047":"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expected\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor even dared to hope\u00e2\u20ac\u201din the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.","1048":"That central bank independence promotes lower inflation in developed countries is well-established by the economic literature.","1049":"First, the significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has clearly had an important restraining effect on U.S. inflation, both via the direct effect on the prices of imported goods and on the pricing power of domestic firms producing import-competing goods.","1050":"For the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, they find heterogeneous views among voters, but no systematic differences based on whether the MPC member is an insider--that is part of the hierarchy at the Bank--or an outsider appointed for a short term just to the MPC; whether the person comes from an academic background; or whether that person has worked at the Treasury.","1051":"China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation.","1052":"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.","1053":"Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable, although market-based measures of inflation compensation over the next five years, as well as over the five-year period beginning five years ahead, moved down further over the intermeeting period.","1054":"The first round of the three-month U. S. dollar auctions that major foreign central banks announced on September 15 was held in October; demand was quite limited, and only the European Central Bank (ECB) drew on its swap line with the Federal Reserve.","1055":"On balance, in light of the uncertainties in the outlook and given that a variety of special factors would continue to contain inflation for a time, the Committee could await further developments bearing on the strength of inflationary pressures without incurring a significant risk that disruptive policy actions would be needed later in response to an upturn in inflation and inflation expectations.","1056":"But there\u2019s also a role for monetary policy.","1057":"But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.","1058":"In their assessment of factors leading to this decision, the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply, even before earlier Committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects.","1059":"Survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years.","1060":"Financial conditions affecting emerging market economies continued to improve for a time after the Committee eased monetary policy at its November 17 meeting, but that trend was subsequently reversed after Brazil's legislature decided to reject a key fiscal reform measure.","1061":"The July-August deficit in U. S. trade in goods and services was higher than its average in the second quarter, as further growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports.","1062":"This approach adds to what we have learned from earlier papers that have examined the performance of unconventional policy tools with respect to individual components of financial conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmost notably, long-term sovereign yields, but also mortgage rates, equities, exchange rates, and corporate debt spreads.3 Empirically assessing the question in the report is not only important, but also challenging, as the report readily acknowledges.","1063":"And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures.","1064":"Inflation-targeting regimes make sense only if the central bank has independent control of the instruments of monetary policy, as holding the central bank responsible for meeting its inflation target is hardly possible otherwise.","1065":"Here in the United States, my colleague Governor Mike Kelley has stated that we are likely to see some disruptions to economic activity because of Year 2000 problems but the effects are likely to be temporary and quickly reversed.","1066":"But the cumulative force of recent developments appears likely to yield a slowing in the pace of growth next year.","1067":"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July and August, with strong gains in private-sector jobs and declines in government employment.","1068":"In that regard, the prospective strength of demand pressures and related outlook for productivity were subject to a wide range of uncertainty, and there were reasons to believe that economic growth could well slow without any adjustment to policy.","1069":"They also noted that even with this additional firming the risks were still weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflationary pressures.","1070":"But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.","1071":"A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.","1072":"Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.","1073":"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.","1074":"It also affects stock prices.","1075":"It is important to note, however, that although sound policy undoubtedly helped create the conditions for growth, macroeconomic policy cannot create growth itself.","1076":"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.","1077":"Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand.","1078":"However, I can provide you with some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and global economies.","1079":"That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perhaps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.","1080":"Members noted that most broad measures of inflation moved together over extended periods of time, but they did not always do so over short intervals.","1081":"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","1082":"But is it really true that prices are more responsive to productivity than wages?","1083":"And as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow the pace of purchases such that our balance sheet grows in line with trend demand for our liabilities.","1084":"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves.","1085":"A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs.","1086":"And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers\u2019 incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is.","1087":"The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.","1088":"Conclusion The United States productivity growth spurt, realized to a much lesser extent around the world, can be attributed largely to a combination of an investment boom and a technological revolution.","1089":"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, boosted in part by favorable earnings reports from the retail sector.","1090":"We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that.","1091":"Some participants believed that considerable labor market slack remained, especially when indicators other than the unemployment rate were taken into account, including the unusually large fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons.","1092":"The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures, although the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.","1093":"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a \"moderate\" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","1094":"Scholars disagree somewhat about the extent to which policymakers of the time tried actively to take advantage of this supposed tradeoff, but these ideas likely provided part of the intellectual rationale that made the authorities willing to allow inflation to rise throughout the 1960s and in the early 1970s.","1095":"In keeping with its usual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments.","1096":"But I do think that\u2014and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that\u2019s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.","1097":"And similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some economies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.","1098":"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.","1099":"As always, our actions are guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.","1100":"As the factors restraining economic growth are projected to fade further over time, the median rate rises to 3 percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run normal level.","1101":"In addition, the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in the first week of November showed that interest rates on C&I loans were generally little changed while spreads remained extremely wide.","1102":"To achieve its mandated objectives, the FOMC must influence the course of the U.S. economy, helping it to grow rapidly enough to make full use of available resources but not so rapidly as to stoke inflation.","1103":"This term has been interpreted by many observers to mean that the Committee's reaction function aimed to be symmetric on either side of the 2 percent inflation goal, and that the FOMC set policy with the (ex ante) aim that the 2 percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions following economic downturns in which inflation falls below target.","1104":"The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad.","1105":"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.","1106":"A few participants argued that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run would erode the stability of inflation expectations.","1107":"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in July.","1108":"Those participants saw substantial slack in resource utilization and hence continued to judge that inflation was likely to remain subdued over the medium term as the economy continued to recover.","1109":"Generally speaking, the growth of profits and the related buildup of cash have been broadly distributed across industries.","1110":"For example, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.3 percentage points since March, and new claims for unemployment insurance have moved somewhat higher.","1111":"For example, in his monetary policy testimony of July 1992, Chairman Greenspan said, \"As I have often noted to this committee, the most important contribution the Federal Reserve can make to encouraging the highest sustainable growth the U.S. economy can deliver over time is to provide a backdrop of reasonably stable prices on average for business and household decisionmaking\" (Greenspan, 1992, pp.","1112":"First, policymakers should continuously update their estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap, using all available information, particularly the realizations of unemployment, output, and inflation.","1113":"The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half-century lows for almost two years.","1114":"A main reason I expect this outcome is simply the fact that the very low inflation readings during last spring's deep economic contraction will drop from the usual calculation of 12-month price changes.","1115":"Because inflation normally responds slowly to such shocks, inflation targeters could respond in any of three ways.","1116":"We indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.","1117":"Median inflation in the nine countries likewise declined, averaging 9-1\/2 percent in 1995-99 and 5 percent in 2000-04.Return to text 4.","1118":"Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.","1119":"In addition, at every policy meeting, each member of the MPC is operating with the same information from the staff, and before the quarterly meetings that precede an Inflation Report, the members have sat through a number of discussions covering all aspects of the forecast.","1120":"And inflation is well above target.","1121":"Total nonfarm payroll employment was reported to have decreased in September, consistent with a substantial increase in the number of people who reported themselves as being absent from work due to bad weather and with payroll declines in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida.","1122":"The pace of inventory liquidation was thought likely to moderate in coming quarters and subsequently turn to accumulation as inventories came into better balance with sales, with increasingly positive implications for overall production and economic activity.","1123":"In these circumstances, inflation pressures could be expected to remain subdued and some further disinflation might well occur.","1124":"And you know, we haven\u2019t yet\u2014we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure\u2014just touched it for a few months, and then we\u2019ve fallen back.","1125":"Most participants remarked that the standard of \"substantial further progress\" had been met with regard to the Committee's price-stability goal or that it was likely to be met soon.","1126":"The fundamental price of an asset typically is defined in terms of the discounted present value of the income stream or equivalent services that the asset is expected to provide over time.","1127":"There was a lot of pent-up demand.","1128":"And we\u2019ve seen significant outflows of capital from those countries, pressures on their exchange rates, and concerns about their performance going forward.","1129":"While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.","1130":"That apparently has not made its way into prices yet, but how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?","1131":"With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices.","1132":"So in\u2014in\u2014in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent.","1133":"Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.","1134":"I look forward to my conversation with Steve Liesman and to your questions, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","1135":"In addition, some policymakers observed that the timing and magnitude of future policy adjustments would ultimately be determined by the Committee's interpretation of the incoming data on the economy and prices rather than by its current expectation of those developments.","1136":"The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.","1137":"Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening.","1138":"However, participants generally saw these downward pressures on inflation starting to abate next year, with widespread distribution of vaccines reducing social-distancing concerns and spurring economic activity.","1139":"He was concerned that the flattening yield curve was partly due to falling longer-term inflation expectations or a lower neutral real rate of interest.","1140":"Monetary Policy Spillovers Flow in Both Directions There is a vast literature that documents the existence of international spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging markets (EMs).","1141":"Without a reduction of aggregate demand growth, inflation would rise.","1142":"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.","1143":"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.","1144":"In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending?","1145":"In contrast to price inflation, labor costs appeared to have remained quiescent.","1146":"Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation.","1147":"But this is largely accounted for by a convergence of inflation rates.","1148":"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\u201das well as our maximum-employment mandate\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1\/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","1149":"In general, participants viewed recent consumer price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis.","1150":"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, \"computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.\"","1151":"Despite the substantial monetary easing that had been implemented already and the fiscal stimulus, including federal tax rebates, that was in train, the forecast anticipated that sluggish hiring and the decline in household wealth would restrain the growth of both consumer spending and housing demand.","1152":"Indeed, scattered evidence dating back to ancient Rome and before reflects the same order of interest rate magnitude, not a one percent interest rate nor 200 percent.","1153":"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation; increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.","1154":"On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of greater-than-expected inflationary pressures, particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered inflation dynamics.","1155":"In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff.","1156":"By fostering increased interactions among central banks, academics, and the public in many different countries, globalization has helped spread a common culture that stresses the benefits of achieving price stability.","1157":"In these models, each asset price contains a risk premium that represents the additional return demanded by risk-averse investors for bearing risk.","1158":"The unmooring of inflation expectations greatly complicated the process of making monetary policy; in particular, the Fed's loss of credibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.","1159":"Moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures.","1160":"From the end of 2000 to the end of 2003, productivity rose at a 3-1\/2 percent annual rate and, even after recent downward revisions to the data, it is estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 2-1\/4 percent since the end of 2003.","1161":"Since inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn't make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near-term inflation expectations.","1162":"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : \"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions.","1163":"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","1164":"The demand for commercial paper declined as prime money market mutual funds experienced large net outflows after the net asset value of one such fund fell below $1 per share.","1165":"However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","1166":"Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth.","1167":"After robust growth in the second quarter, M2 decelerated somewhat and M3 was about unchanged in July.","1168":"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.","1169":"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting in June the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","1170":"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment; the approach can be applied equally well by \"inflation hawks,\" \"growth hawks,\" and anyone in between.","1171":"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.","1172":"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.","1173":"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance.","1174":"As is evident in the right-hand chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems to be quite strong.","1175":"Our test for this step was making \"substantial further progress\" toward our employment and inflation goals.","1176":"Concepts associated with deflation such as liquidity traps and the zero bound on nominal interest rates had, for practical purposes, disappeared from economic thought.","1177":"What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy.","1178":"Consumer spending firmed somewhat during the first quarter despite the rising unemployment rate and significant financial strains.","1179":"Implications of Increases in Productivity Growth In the long run, the implications of increases in productivity growth rates are fairly obvious.","1180":"Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.","1181":"Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee's reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.","1182":"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of
